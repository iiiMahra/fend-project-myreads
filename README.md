# MyReads Project
This app was created using React.
It allows the user to classify the books to currently reading, want to read and read by moving them to the appropriate shelves. Also the user can search for books by clicking the green plus button in the bottom right corner of the main page.

## How to run the  Project :- 
- Download the repository
- Install npm install
- Run npm start to start the server

## Note :-

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in SEARCH_TERMS.md. That list of terms are the only terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
